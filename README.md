### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer who specializes in frontend web development. Occasionally, I dabble in various stuff such as UI/UX design, backend development, automation (webhooks, e2e testing), Flutter, and many more.

I aspire to be somebody who can solve complex problems, someone that others can always depend on. Always eager to broaden my experiences, learn more and experiment more. Currently, I am focusing on being more knowledgeable on designing, architecturing and solutions.

Outside of the stuff above, some of my passions are photography, photo editing, PCs, and tech gadgets.
